# Documentation Section

Hello! In this folder i will document everything i do every week. 


# The Start - First Week

In my first week i focused learning the basics of Unity, following the official Unity's tutorial. Im still not done learning them yet, since the "First Week" actually started from Wednesday, 
so counting today it has been only 3 days!
What i learnt in this week is:

- How to move in Unity's 3D space
- How to add new GameObjects and how to shape the how i want
- Properties, like: Position, rotation, material
- Learnt the basics of Unity's physics with rigid bodies, physic materials and mesh collider
- (Not done yet) Building a bedroom using Unity Essential's prefabs

For the next week my objectives are:
- Learning all Unity's basics and completing Unity Essential's Course
- Start playing around in Unity and being able to create simple things on my own

This is all for week one, see you next week!!


# Second week 

The end of the second week came, and I completed Unity's Essential tutorial, so one of the goals of the last week is reached. I even made a script that makes the camera follow the player, i'm sure it works on 2D since 
i made it for that, but i didn't test if it works on 3D too. Now a quick summary of what i've done in this week:

- How to add audio, 2D and 3D one, and how to adjust their properties
- Started getting into coding with Unity's tutorial assistance, and i made a movement script and an object rotate.
- Making a door open when the player is near
- Built a room in 2D, and added animated sprites
- Made a script, attached to the camera, that makes it follow the player.
- Made a main menu where you can access all the experience from it and play them

I'm gonna publish that project and the scripts i made soon.
Objectives for the next week:
- Make a movement script all by myself
- Working with UI and starting to make an inventory system.

This is all for week two, see you next one!!


# Third week

Here it is week three's documentation, this week i managed to make a movement script for a ball, i used the AddTorque method and i added the possibility to switch to the AddForce method movement system with a simple click,
I made a camera system pretty much similar to the one i already made previously, but now its for 3D. I worked a bit on UI and i made a button that when pressed it shows on screen a big panel, just like an inventory, then i
used the UI grid to place some other square panels inside the "Inventory panel". So i reached the last week's goals. After that i tried to make a grappling system but it didn't go as expected and i badly failed in making
it.. Failed as another thing i tried to make this week, i tried to modify the camera script so that when you moved your mouse the camera would rotate, the script was working, the camera was rotating, but the movement
COMPLETELY BROKE, the ball started going in random direction and it was not stopping... I came to the conclusion to maybe start making other simpler things and then go back to those things.

Quick summary of what i did this week:
- Made a movement script for a ball with switchable movement systems (Torque and Force)
- Camera script that follows the ball and always look towards it
- Inventory system
- Failed in making a grappling system and modifying the camera script to make it rotate when you move your mouse.

that's all for this week! See you next one!!
