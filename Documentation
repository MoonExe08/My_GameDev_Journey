# The Start - First Week

In my first week i focused learning the basics of Unity, following the official Unity's tutorial. Im still not done learning them yet, since the "First Week" actually started from Wednesday, so counting today it has been only 3 days!
What i learnt in this week is:
- How to move in Unity's 3D space
- How to add new GameObjects and how to shape the how i want
- Properties, like: Position, rotation, material
- Learnt the basics of Unity's physics with rigid bodies, physic materials and mesh collider
- (Not done yet) Building a bedroom using Unity Essential's prefabs

For the next week my objectives are:
- Learning all Unity's basics and completing Unity Essential's Course
- Start playing around in Unity and being able to create simple things on my own

This is all for week one, see you next week!!
